Four Enemies:
	Red : Chases directly
	Pink: Aims for a position in front of pacman's mouth
	Cyan: "Sometimes" heads towards Pac-man, and other times away.
	Orange: "Random behavior" but alternates from behaving like the red and 
		 when at some distance from Pac-Man and aiming towards the lower-left
		corner of the maze whenever it gets too close to him.


Food:
	Adds to the high score.
	When you eat all the food, the level is then complete.

Pac-Man:
	Eats food, eats powerup and then can kill the ghost for a limited time.
	If you touch the ghost, then you lose a life and restart in the middle with the last game state.
